/**
 * Class represents statistics from all MLB baseball teams and all of
 * their seasons from 1962 to 2012.
 *
 * Fields:
 * team: string: The abbreviation of the team that the rest of the data in the row is for.
 * league: string: The league that the team plays in, either the National League (NL) or the
 *                  American League (AL). This is important as the two leagues have differing
 *                  rules that can affect a teamâ€™s statistics depending on the league they play in.
 * year: integer: The season that the data is from.
 * runsScored: integer: The number of runs scored by a team over the entire season.
 * runsAllowed: integer: The number of runs allowed by a team over the entire season.
 * wins: integer: Number of games a team won that season.
 * obp (On-Base Percentage): float: The average rate a team gets on base per at-bat.
 * slg (Slugging Percentage): float: A stat to signify the number of bases each hit results in, and
                                    the frequency that they occur. (Similar to batting average but
                                    a double is worth 2x, triple 3x, and home run 4x).
 * avg (Batting Average): float: The average rate at which a team will get a hit per at-bat.
 * playoffs: integer: 1 if the team made the playoffs that year, 0 if they did not.
 * seasonRank: integer: If the team made the playoffs, this signifies what their season rank was.
 * playoffRank: integer: In what place they finished in the playoffs, so 1 would mean that they
                         won the world series.
 * games: integer: The number of games a team played in that season.
 * oOBP (Opponent On-Base Percentage): float: The rate at which their opponents got on base per at bat.
 * oSLG (Opponent Slugging Percentage): float: The rate at which their opponents got hits, and how many
                                               bases each one resulted in.
